% LETTER CONTENT

% Desired Length: 200-250 words; and specific to job qualifications and why this company.

It is with immense excitement to have the opportunity to work for \employer{} due to its {high-level techniques and collaboration among the most talented minds.} With a double major in Mathematics and Statistics at UC Berkeley, I believe I have a strong {quantitative} background to more than meet the demands for {the position}. Next September, I am also pursuing a one-year S.M. program at Harvard University in Computational Science \& Engineering.

My {problem solving skills} derive from having taken and excelled in graduate-level courseloads for the past three years. This has allowed me to cultivate indispensable practices: tackle highly intricate problems with a considerable degree of research, collaborate extensively with colleagues, and frequently discuss material with professors during scheduled appointments.

I also have strong {organizational and teamwork} skills. Under a team of three graduate statisticians, we modeled a network of financial institutions in order to quantify contagion and systemic risk within a country. I personally took advantage of the structure of these problems to improve performance, e.g., using a multi-threaded sparse QR algorithm in order to efficently decompose big data.

\employer{} would provide me with the ability to apply my research knowledge to industrial foundations, and also expose me to {finance}---a field I find mathematically captivating. Please let me know if there are any further materials or information that will assist you in processing my application. Thank you for your consideration, and I look forward to hearing from you.
